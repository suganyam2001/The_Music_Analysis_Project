# Music Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Billboard chart data and Spotify track audio features over the past 25 years to uncover trends that can inform strategies for successful music production and distribution. The goal is to understand the shift in music consumption, particularly the rise of singles, collaborations, and artist popularity, and how these factors influence chart success.

## Key Insights
- **Shift to Singles**: The dominance of singles over albums, driven by streaming platforms, shows a preference for shorter, more frequent releases.
- **Collaborations**: Tracks with multiple contributing artists tend to have greater stability on the charts due to broader audience appeal.
- **Follower Growth**: Artists with larger followings and frequent releases have a higher potential for sustained success.
- **Content Characteristics**: While explicit content is growing in popularity, clean tracks tend to have better long-term chart performance.
- **Negligible Impact of Audio Features**: Factors like danceability, energy, and tempo have minimal impact on chart performance, suggesting that strategic marketing and collaborations are more important.

## Analysis Questions
1. **How has the rise of singles influenced the music industry over time?**
2. **Do tracks with more contributing artists show greater stability in chart performance?**
3. **How does an artist's popularity and follower count correlate with success?**
